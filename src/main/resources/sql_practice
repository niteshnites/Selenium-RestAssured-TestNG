JOINS Statements
JOIN and INNER JOIN will return the same result.
INNER is the default join type for JOIN, so when you write JOIN the parser actually writes INNER JOIN.
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
SELF JOIN: A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

SELECT Customers.ContactName, Customers.Country, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryName
FROM Products
JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;
